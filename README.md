Attention
=========
As this repository is getting a lot of clones for such an old and simple project I have to mention this:

If you want to get this to compile you will need to download the model project as well: 
https://github.com/s4ke/BlockBreakerModel

You will also probably need to change some of the AndEndgine related stuff as this game was written against an AndEngine version from 2011/2012
